If you [send me](https://keiwando.com/contact) a description of what you were doing when it crashed, which device it was running on and optimally even the crash logs, I can look into the cause and hopefully fix the issue with a future update. 

The more details you can give me, the more likely Iâ€˜m going to be able to fix the crash.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
