    <p>We do not collect, process or share any Personal Data from your usage of the Rocket Space Launch app.</p>
    <p>Rocket Space Launch uses <a href="dreamlo.com">dreamlo.com</a> to offer a global online leaderboard, which your highscores will be submitted to fully anonymised under the name "Anonymus". You can choose to change this display name to whatever you like. This name can potentially be viewed by anyone else who uses the Rocket Space Launch game. Be mindful of which name you choose for your highscore submissions and don't include any personal or secret information.</p>
    <p>Each submitted piece of data consists of a display name which defaults to "Anonymus", a number representing the player's score and a randomly generated piece of text used by the app to distinguish different score submissions with the same display name.</p>
